  title: NSP Participant Screening Profile API Endpoint
  description: |
    NSP API for getting participant screening profiles with support for pagination based on a date range.

    - Multiple calls with the same query parameters will return the same data.
    - Data may be removed from the NSP after 90 days (to be confirmed).
    - The API authentication process will be documented in Confluence.
    - Data will be retrieved and ordered based on the dates the records were last modified in the NSP (recordUpdateDateTime).
    - The API does not support caching responses; each response will contain live data.
  version: 1.0.0
